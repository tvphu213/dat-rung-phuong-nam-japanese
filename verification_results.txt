VERIFICATION RESULTS - Subtask 1-2
===================================

Objective: Verify generated HTML is identical to pre-refactor version

Method:
1. Generated HTML with post-refactor code (current HEAD)
2. Checked out pre-refactor version (commit b2aff29)
3. Generated HTML with pre-refactor code
4. Compared both outputs

Results:
✅ Files are BYTE-FOR-BYTE IDENTICAL
   - Byte count: 948,380 bytes (both versions)
   - Line count: 4,627 lines (both versions)
   - diff output: No differences found

✅ Paragraph Structure Verified
   - Total paragraphs in HTML: 150
   - Japanese Chapter 1 paragraphs: 24
   - Aggressive merging working correctly
   - Long merged paragraphs as expected

✅ Generated HTML Size: 564,563 bytes (both versions)

Conclusion:
The refactoring successfully replaced duplicated paragraph parsing logic
with a call to read_chapter_paragraphs() while maintaining IDENTICAL
output behavior. The aggressive merging logic works correctly for
Japanese chapters.
